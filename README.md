# MPSPLIB Benchmark with P-SGS/MINSLK on MSProject
Repository containing benchmark results for instances of the MPSPLib library (http://www.mpsplib.com/) obtained with the implementation in MS Project of the heuristic based on the P-SGS/MINSLK algorithm to address the Resource Constrained Multi-Project Scheduling Problem (RCMPSP).  
Additionally, a VBA script with the heuristic implementation is provided, along with instructions for installing it in MS Project.

## Source of Original Instances
The original problem instances were obtained from the MPSPLib (http://www.mpsplib.com/), developed by **Jörg Homberger**<sup>1</sup>.  
These have been previously converted into `.mpp` format for compatibility with Microsoft Project. Instance names respect the original source.   
This converted instances of the MPSPLib library are available at https://github.com/INSISOC/MPSPLIBtoMPP.
